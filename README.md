To run mediSeach, open mediSearch.m in MATLAB and set your working directory to the master branch. Then simply press the "run" button. In the screen that pops up, enter a medicare DRG Definition (found at goo.gl/WZwciD) into the text box on your region, then press the search button for that region. Two windows pop up: a graph showing the number of DRGs oerformed in each state in your region and a table of all of the hospitals in your region with their corresponding data.

Future improvements could include replacing the graph with one that shows the number of hospitals that perform your specific DRG within your region, along with more filtering options.

Screenshots/video coming soon!
